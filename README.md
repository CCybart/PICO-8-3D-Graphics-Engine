# PICO-8-3D-Graphics-Engine
Here is all the code for the test scene for my 3D graphics engine written in PICO-8, as well as the 3D modeling program I wrote for it.

This code isn't able to be run except in PICO-8, and is only here for show. This project was the product of around 2 years of work on and off, and unfortunately I don't have much to show for it. There is a single demo game I made in a day on my PICO-8 Blog linked below.

A large amount of that time and effort was spent optimizing the code, as PICO-8 has severe memory and RAM limitations. I'm very proud of the state that it reached, and there is almost nothing I can do at this point to make the code more efficient without sacrificing some other aspect of its design that I deemed necessary for the purposes I needed it for.

Although I started work on a large game that used this, I became too busy with school work to continue it and have since moved onto other projects.

I learned a lot making this, but most of all I learned (through not succeeding at first) how to not become burnt out on projects and manage goals effectively.

Here is a link to my PICO-8 Blog with other projects, as well as a short demo of the 3D engine I made: https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=51350
