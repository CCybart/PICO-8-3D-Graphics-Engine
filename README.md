# PICO-8-3D-Graphics-Engine
Here is all the code for the test scene for my 3D graphics engine written in PICO-8, as well as the 3D modeling program I wrote for it.
Although I started work on a game that used these, I became too busy with school work to continue it and have since moved onto other projects.
I learned a lot making these, but most of all I learned (through not succeeding at them) how to not become burnt out on projects and manage goals effectively.
Here is a link to my PICO-8 Blog with other projects, as well as a short demo of the 3D engine I made: https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=51350
